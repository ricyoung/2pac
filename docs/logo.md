## About This Logo

This logo represents the fusion of Tupac Shakur's revolutionary spirit with the world of technology. It symbolizes how 2PAC (The Picture Analyzer & Corruption killer) brings a powerful edge to image corruption detection and repair.

The image was created using AI to imagine Tupac as a programmer, connecting his artistic legacy with the digital tools we build today. Just as Tupac used his art to bring important issues to light, this tool helps users identify and resolve hidden problems in their digital image collections.

## Usage Guidelines

This logo may be used in:
- Documentation referring to the 2PAC tool
- Presentations about the project
- Blog posts and articles discussing the software

Please maintain the connection to the memorial aspect of this project when using this imagery.

## Design Philosophy

The design combines:
- The iconic imagery of Tupac Shakur
- Modern computing aesthetics
- A serious but creative tone that reflects both the technical nature of the tool and the artistic spirit that inspired it

This represents our commitment to building tools that both serve a practical purpose and honor the creative, community-focused values that Jeff Young embodied.
