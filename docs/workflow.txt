This is a placeholder for the workflow image.
You should replace this with an actual workflow diagram image.

The workflow should illustrate:
1. The image file validation process
2. The repair workflow for corrupted images
3. The progress saving and resumption system

For best results, create a simple flowchart using a tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or similar.
