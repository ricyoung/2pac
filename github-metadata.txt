## Short Description
Find and eliminate corrupt image files with visual detection. In memory of Jeff Young.

## Detailed Description
2PAC (Picture Analyzer & Corruption killer) is a lightning-fast tool for finding and eliminating corrupt image files from your photo collection. It includes intelligent visual corruption detection to identify images with large gray/black areas that traditional validation misses. Unlike other tools, 2PAC can distinguish between technical corruption and visible corruption, helping you preserve viewable images while eliminating truly damaged ones.
